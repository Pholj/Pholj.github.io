    <h1> OMORI | DEC 2024 - JAN 2025 | Written from JAN 4th - ...</h1>
    <h3> I'm writing this about a week after I've completed the game and 
        will try my best to recall my thoughts.</h3>

    <h3> To accidentally kill. Whilst not the main theme of OMORI as the game focuses on
        the main character's, Sunny, grieving and his process of opening up to his trauma rather than
        hiding away from it, I found that topic to be of relevance to my personal fears. 
        
        To accidentally kill or to commit any mistake that drastically impacts your life is a fear that
        is often forgotten as its likely to be an accident with no build up. In these scenarios, a life
        is often forever altered. In the case of Sunny, his murder of his sister takes away from her life
        and completely changes his. Not only does it impact Sunny, but his friends are also impacted. Specifcally,
        I find Aubrey to be a tragic character. As they are all kids, Aubrey ends up getting cut off
        by her peers even though she needed them to cope with Mari's death. This is even worse 
        considering we see her broken household which contributes to her stress and dealing with
        Mari's loss with her delinquent act.
