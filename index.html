    <h2> With a new year I want to create some goals which I plan on completing for this year. 
        There will be multiple subpages in this site which will updated across the duration of the year. 
        I plan on practicing my CSS skills along with it but that is not the focus of this page as it is a collection of my thoughts on various subjects.
        Some goals will be listed below which I plan on completing in the near future:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Reviews/Reflections on some of my favorite media I've consumed</li>
            <li> Reflect on Crime and Punishment </li>
            <li> Document my TSA project</li>
            <li> Document my 60 day Arduino Learning and my CAD learning</li>
            <li> create a physical project with the arduino</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Here are some goals I plan on completing through out the year:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> learn some Supervised learning, creating a CNN for Thai</li>
            <li> learn some Reinforcement learning, creating a simple model with my own skills</li>
            <li> Be mindful of my media consumption and document them here.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Thats it for this introduction. Good bye.</h2>
